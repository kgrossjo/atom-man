# man package

Display Unix man pages inside Atom.  This has been tested with OSX.  It probably
needs work for Linux.  It is not applicable to Windows.  (Or do we want to
display Cygwin man pages on Windows?)

## Usage

There is a "Man: Man" command in the command palette.  It asks for the man page
to view.
